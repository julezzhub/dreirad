            <b>WHAT IS THIS?</b><br>
            Basically, we're two people who bought a Rickshaw in India, are going to learn how to drive and fix our little jalopy, and then drive it all the way from the South to the North of India.
            That's about three thousand kilometers on three wheels, and all that in - you guessed it - two weeks. This trip is called the <a href="https://www.theadventurists.com/guides/rickshaw-run/" id="extlink">Rickshaw Run</a>, a "charity-fundraiser-turned-rally", and in the past, has seen
            teams raise over two million pounds for a good cause. <br><br>

            <b>WAIT WHAT?</b><br>
            Yes, as if India's roads were not packed enough already, right?
            What was originally designed as an urban taxi will be raced all the way across the Indian subcontinent.
            With about seventy other teams, we'll embark on the journey of a lifetime.
            We'll spend a day learning how to drive and repair engineering's highest life form, and then take this glorified lawnmower from A (Kochi) to B (Jaisalmer), raising money for charity in the process.
            Given the inadequacy of our vehicle, there's not much sense in planning ahead. So: no fixed route, no support - apart from your charitable help and loving thoughts that is.
            <br><br>
            <b>AND WHAT CAN I DO?</b><br>
            If you want to become a part of our trip, be it through your name, face or flag on our beautiful three-wheeler, check how to support us and our selected charities below. But we'll get to that in a second...

              Weirdly enough that wasn't a part of his engineering degree.
              Whilst everyone is stocking up on desinfectants, he's hoarding all the electrolytes he can find.

              Eager to explore India's football hooligan scene, provisionally supporting the Kerala Blasters because their disappointing form reminds him of his local team.
              Last time he's driven a three-wheeler was probably when he mastered his baby tricycle.
              Knows *some* Indian dances and has bollywood experience, though, so that should sort him out.

          Cool Earth works alongside indigenous villages to halt rainforest destruction. Local people stand to lose the most from deforestation but the most to gain from its protection,
          which is why they are the forest’s best possible custodians. All Cool Earth partnerships are community-owned and led. By developing local livelihoods,
          their mission is to end the cycle of deforestation entrenching villages into further poverty. They create strong, self-determining communities instead of dependency.

          Make a Difference India mobilises young leaders towards ensuring equitable outcomes for children in need of care and protection.
          Their long term goal is to change how both system and families care for and invest in children, targeting stable middle-class adult outcomes for all the children they work with.
          We will visit their headquarters in Bangalore just before we kick off.

      <h1>BE OUR THIRD WHEEL</h1>
      <p>There's tons of ways you can support us - through kind words, thoughts and prayers, cheering us on, sharing our campaign with your friends,
        and of course through your personal donations. After all, this is a fundraiser, and <b>all</b> of your contributions will go towards charitable causes.<br>
        To sweeten the deal for you, we thought of some ways we could make all of you become a part of our journey. So, beyond our eternal gratitude, every donor will have their name on our Rickshaw
        and our team outfits. And there's more...
      </p>
      <div class="support">
        <img src="images/postcard.jpg" alt="postcard" style="width:100%">
        <p>If you want to go above and beyond, everyone donating 20€ or more will get a postcard and some team stickers delivered straight to their door.</p>
        <p>Every donation over 100€ will receive a photo album and a traditional Indian fashion accessory sourced straight from a local market on top of that - and we'll call you up to congratulate you on your fantastic fashion sense.</p>
        <img src="#" alt="#">
        <p>
          If somehow, be it with a group or by yourself, you find yourself commemorating our little three-wheeler with a donation of 300€ or more, we would probably be lost for words at first, and then go on to commemorate *you* by letting you pimp our rickshaw.
          Add a flag (preferrably Hamburg's) or a face (preferrably yours) to our vehicle, which will accompany us for the entirety of the trip.
        </p>
        <img src="#" alt="#">
        <p>
          So please, be the Ted to our Marshall and Lilly, the Harry to our Ron and Hermoine, the third wheel for us
          and our Rickshaw. Join the Dreirad Fund and support Cool Earth and MAD India.</p>
